Either way, if you haven’t watched Daisy Jones & the Six, the Amazon Prime ten-parter, then I’m here to tell you that you really, really should. Mainly you should watch it because it is just so much fun. Sexy, gripping, atmospheric, the sofa-viewing equivalent of a perfect sunlounger summer novel. (It is based on Taylor Jenkins Reid’s perfect sunlounger read of the same name.) But specifically you should watch it for its wardrobe, because it is a blueprint for the most delicious summer-holiday style."

In 2021, Naomi Osaka caused major controversy after she decided to snub post-match press obligations to protect her mental health, following which mental strife and injury brought the career of the four-time Major champion to a halt. Two years on, on Sunday, Belarus’ Aryna Sabalenka got past a tetchy fourth-round encounter against Sloane Stephens, and then skipped the obligatory press conference for the second time in succession. Sabalenka’s reasons were the same as Osaka, but have been part of a wider headache for organisers throughout the event."

There are now mascaras that condition and strengthen your lashes, lipsticks infused with peptides and hyaluronic acid, and foundations, like Laura Mercier’s latest, which is chock full of antioxidants that treat everything from fine lines to dark spots. You shouldn’t have to compromise on skincare for a bit of colour."
